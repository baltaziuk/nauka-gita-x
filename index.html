            <h1>Pink Floyd</h1>
            <h2>Pigs (Three Different Ones)</h2>
            <p>Big man, pig man<br>
                Ha, ha, charade you are<br>
                You well heeled big wheel<br>
                Ha, ha, charade you are<br>
                And when your hand is on your heart<br>
                You're nearly a good laugh<br>
                Almost a joker<br>
                With your head down in the pig bin<br>
                Saying 'Keep on digging'<br>
                Pig stain on your fat chin<br>
                What do you hope to find<br>
                Down in the pig mine?<br>
                You're nearly a laugh<br>
                You're nearly a laugh<br>
                But you're really a cry<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Bus stop rat bag<br>
                Ha, ha, charade you are<br>
                You fucked up old hag<br>
                Ha, ha, charade you are<br>
                You radiate cold shafts of broken glass<br>
                You're nearly a good laugh<br>
                Almost worth a quick grin<br>
                You like the feel of steel<br>
                You're hot stuff with a hatpin<br>
                And good fun with a hand gun<br>
                You're nearly a laugh<br>
                You're nearly a laugh<br>
                But you're really a cry<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Hey you, Whitehouse<br>
                Ha, ha, charade you are<br>
                You house proud town mouse<br>
                Ha, ha, charade you are<br>
                You're trying to keep our feelings off the street<br>
                You're nearly a real treat<br>
                All tight lips and cold feet<br>
                And do you feel abused?<br>
                You got to stem the evil tide<br>
                And keep it all on the inside<br>
                Mary you're nearly a treat<br>
                Mary you're nearly a treat<br>
                But you're really a cry<br>
            </p>
